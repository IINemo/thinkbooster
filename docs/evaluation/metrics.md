## Primary Metrics

### 1. Accuracy (Exact Match)

Percentage of samples where the predicted answer exactly matches the gold answer.

```python
accuracy = correct_answers / total_samples * 100
```

- Uses string matching after normalization
- Implementation: [`thinkbooster/evaluation/exact_match.py`](../../thinkbooster/evaluation/exact_match.py)

**Reported as**: `XX.X%` (e.g., `26.7%`)

---

### 2. Token Count

Total number of tokens generated across all traces/paths for a sample.

```python
# Per sample
total_tokens = sum(trace["num_tokens"] for trace in all_traces)

# Dataset aggregation
avg_tokens_per_sample = mean([sample_total_tokens for all samples])
total_tokens_dataset = sum([sample_total_tokens for all samples])
```

**Reported as**:
- Per sample: total tokens (e.g., `45,230 tokens`)
- Dataset: average tokens per sample (e.g., `42,150 avg tokens/sample`)

---

### 3. Compute Cost (FLOPs)

Estimated floating-point operations required for autoregressive inference.

#### Approximate Formula

For transformer language models, FLOPs per generated token during **inference** can be approximated by:

```python
flops_per_token = 2 * num_parameters
```

This follows the compute model introduced in [Kaplan et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) ("Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models"), where inference requires approximately **one forward pass**, yielding an inference cost of **≈ 2N FLOPs**, with `N` equal to the number of non-embedding parameters. The interpretation of *≈2 FLOPs per parameter* aligns with standard FLOP accounting conventions (multiply + add).

#### Example for Qwen3-8B (~8B parameters)

```python
flops_per_token = 2 * 8e9 = 16e9  # 16 GFLOPs/token
```

This approximation is appropriate when comparing generation strategies on the **same model**, because attention-related terms are dominated by dense matrix multiplications in large transformer blocks.

#### Per-Sample and Dataset Compute

```python
# Per sample
total_flops = total_tokens * flops_per_token
total_tflops = total_flops / 1e12
```

**Reported as**: `XXX TFLOPs` (e.g., `672 TFLOPs avg/sample`)

#### Important Notes

- Actual FLOPs vary with sequence length due to attention costs.
- With **KV caching**, the attention computation for each new token is **linear** in sequence length rather than quadratic. This is described in [PaLM (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311) Appendix B.2 and supported by [FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
- The approximate **2N** rule remains accurate in practice unless the sequence length becomes very large.

#### More Precise FLOP Calculation

A full transformer forward pass can be decomposed using the formulation from [PaLM (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311) Appendix B and engineering analyses such as [Kipply (2022)](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/):

```
FLOPs_per_layer = 24 * b * s * h²   +   4 * b * s² * h
                  \_____________/       \____________/
                  FFN + projections        attention
```

Where:
- `b` = batch size
- `s` = sequence length
- `h` = hidden dimension (`d_model`)

During autoregressive inference with a **KV cache**, the second term simplifies from `s²` to `s`, because keys and values for previous tokens are reused. This results in a practical per-token cost dominated by `O(h²)` dense compute.

#### Implementation

FLOP calculation is implemented in [`FLOPCalculator`](../../thinkbooster/utils/flops.py):

```python
from thinkbooster.utils import FLOPCalculator

# Initialize with model name (auto-loads architecture from HuggingFace)
calc = FLOPCalculator("Qwen/Qwen3-8B")

# Compute TFLOPs for token count
tflops = calc.compute_tflops(num_tokens=45000)

# Get TFLOPs per 1k tokens (useful for comparison)
print(f"{calc.tflops_per_1k_tokens:.3f} TFLOPs/1k tokens")
```

In `run_tts_eval.py`, FLOPCalculator is used to track compute cost per sample:
- Initialized after model loading with the model path
- `tflops_this_sample` logged per sample based on `tokens_this_sample`
- `running_total_tflops` accumulated across all samples
- `running_avg_tflops_per_sample` computed as running average

### 5. Token Efficiency

Measures how efficiently tokens are used, especially relevant for early stopping.
