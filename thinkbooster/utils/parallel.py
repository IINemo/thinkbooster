    """
    Execute tasks in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor.

    This utility function handles threading infrastructure, error handling,
    and automatic client recreation on failures (timeouts).

    Args:
        worker_func: Function to execute for each task (must accept one argument)
        task_args: List of arguments to pass to worker_func
        n_workers: Number of parallel workers (default: 8)
        desc: Description for logging (default: "Executing tasks")
        model: Optional model instance for client recreation on failures

    Returns:
        List of results (None results from failed tasks are filtered out)

    Note:
        If ANY tasks fail (e.g., due to timeouts) and model is provided,
        the model's client will be recreated to clear stuck connections.
        This happens automatically for all strategies and scorers.

    Example:
        >>> def worker(args):
        >>>     prompt, index, total = args
        >>>     # Do work...
        >>>     return result
        >>> args_list = [(prompt, i, n) for i in range(n)]
        >>> results = parallel_execute(worker, args_list, n_workers=8, model=my_model)
