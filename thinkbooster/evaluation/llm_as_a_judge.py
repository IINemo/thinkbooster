PROMPT_FULL_SOLUTION = r"""
You will be given a <Problem>, its proposed <Solution>, and the <Gold Answer>.
Your task is to assess whether the solution arrives at the **correct final answer**.

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
1. The solution is ONLY correct if the final answer matches the Gold Answer.
2. Good reasoning with a wrong final answer is INCORRECT.
3. Answers in DIFFERENT FORMS that are MATHEMATICALLY EQUIVALENT should be considered CORRECT. Examples:
   - "sinh(at)/a" equals "(exp(at) - exp(-at))/(2a)"
   - "1/(2√X)" equals "(1/2)X^(-1/2)"
   - "-8 - 8√3 i" equals "-8-8√3i" (spacing differences don't matter)
   - "0.5" equals "1/2"
4. Answers must be EXACTLY equal numerically. There is NO tolerance for approximate values. Examples of INCORRECT answers:
   - "698" does NOT equal "700"
   - "9.7" does NOT equal "9.6"
   - "0.147" does NOT equal "0.15"
   - "0.822" does NOT equal "8.233e-19" (different numbers, even if same physical quantity in different units)

Respond using the **exact format** below, do not include any text outside this template.
Output format:
<start of response>
Solution comments:
... brief comments on the solution ...
Final answer in solution: [extract the final answer from the solution]
Gold answer: [the provided gold answer]
Mathematically equivalent: (Yes|No)
<Grade>: (Correct|Incorrect)
